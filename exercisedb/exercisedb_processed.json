There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\n4.  As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.\n5.  Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.\n6.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n2.  Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3.  Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart. Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (**Note:** For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n4.  Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. **Tip:** If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n5.  Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n6.  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n**Caution:** This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\n\n****Variations:****\n\nAs previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\n\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\n\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides. The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used. I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats. (**Note:** For wide-stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).\n\nAnother way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs. This variation is referred to as weight-belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised, but separated platforms, that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems. The issue however is finding the platforms that meet the criteria. The only way I have been able to perform this is when I have two benches placed opposite to each other with spotting platforms that are facing each other. If you move the benches close enough then you get can execute the weight-belt squats by using the spotting platform.\n\nFinally, you can also perform squats in a Smith Machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the Smith Machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against Smith Machine use for squats. If you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.", "exerciseType": 1, "level": 2, "mainMuscle": 7, "mainMuscleName": "Quadriceps", "otherMuscles": [], "isSport": false, "mechanicType": 1, "force": "N\\A", "equipment": ["Barbell", "Squat Rack", "Weights"], "equipmentType": [2], "equipmentTypes": ["Barbell"]}, {"id": "48352717-e506-40c0-b6cc-d497657b54c8", "stringName": "oblique-cable-crunch", "fullName": "Kneeling cable oblique crunch", "aka": [], "rating": "9", "relatedExercises": ["c3e294a9-279e-4c78-b6ee-a9bf9269317f", "62d0c108-b3d5-4a6a-a52b-8c147fdd1704"], "isActive": true, "benefits": "1.

You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lat as you hold the bar in front of you. The right arm can be kept by the waist. This is the starting position of the exercise.\n4.  Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it as you rotate the wrist, so that by the time your hand is by your abdominals it is in a neutral position (palms facing the torso). Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard.\n5.  Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. **Tip:** Remember to rotate the wrist as you go back to the starting position so that the palms are facing down again.\n6.  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the right hand.\n\n**Variations:** You can perform this movement with a high pulley as well and standing up. You can also perform it doing a full rotation of the wrist.

This will be your starting position. **Note:** For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.\n3.  Begin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. **Tip:** If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.

Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.

Muscles worked include the quads, hips, glutes, and upper hamstrings.", "description": "1.  This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first place a flat bench or a box behind you. The flat bench is used to teach you to set your hips back and to hit depth.\n\n3.  Then, set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n4.  Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n5.  Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (**Note:** For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n6.  Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting your hips back as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. **Tip:** If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n7.  Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.\n8.  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n**Caution:** This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\n\n**Variations:** As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\n\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\n\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides. The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used. I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats. (**Note:** For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).\n\nAnother way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.", "exerciseType": 1, "level": 1, "mainMuscle": 7, "mainMuscleName": "Quadriceps", "otherMuscles": [], "isSport": false, "mechanicType": 1, "force": "N\\A", "equipment": [], "equipmentType": [2], "equipmentTypes": ["Barbell"]}, {"id": "6f2f0774-451a-44f4-a803-c6e82ca46c13", "stringName": "lateral-plate-raises-gethin-variation", "fullName": "Plate lateral raise", "aka": [], "rating": null, "relatedExercises": [], "isActive": true, "benefits": "1.

Keep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the shoulders over the bar.\n3.  As the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible.\n\n**Phase 3: Transition or Scoop Phase**\n\n1.  As the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them. **Tip:** At this point your thighs should be against the bar.\n2.  Keep the back flat or slightly arched, elbows fully extended and your head neutral. **Tip:** You will hold your breath until the next phase.\n\n**Phase 4: Second Pull Phase**\n\n1.  Inhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes.\n2.  Keep the bar as close to your body as possible. **Tip:** Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position. Also, keep your shoulders over the bar and arms straight as long as possible.\n3.

Continue to pull the arms as high and as long as possible. **Tip:** Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.\n\n**Phase 5: Catch Phase**\n\n1.  After the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar.\n2.  Simultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position.\n3.  Once the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles.\n4.  Catch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement.\n5.  Stand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.\n\n**Phase 6: Downward Movement Phase**\n\n1.  Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement.\n2.
